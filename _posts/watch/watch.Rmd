  *  REF:  Gillespie, Lovelace   pg63

2.1.5 Function Objects:

>  A function’s environment is the environment that was active at the time that
>  the function was created. Any symbols bound in that environment are captured
>  and available to the function. This combination of the code of the function and
>  the bindings in its environment is called a ‘function closure’,
